### Value Factor
An algorithm allowing one tree verification to create multiple tokens: # tokens = tree update * (value factor).

A factor of 1 should be a standard tree

Value Factor compensates for:
  - Unique environmental challenges
  - Species diversity versus monoculture
  - Unique Species 
  - Other ecological value  (Air pollution removal, Air temperature reduction, Ultraviolet radiation reduction, Carbon storage, Pollen allergenicity, Wind reduction, erosion reduction, water filtration)
  - Other challanges
  - Tree Spacing
  
  Could be a total points system
